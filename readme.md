## **Python Project #1**
---
*working with  If...Else Statements, F-Strings and Functions*
***

### Description ###
    This first project is a compilation of unconnected exercises all showcasing returns to the user on the console.
    The goal of this project was to familiarise myself with basic Python coding and is using French as the primary mode of communication with the user.

    A LOOPING MENU WAS LATER ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL CODE

### Steps of the Project ###
    ** Step 1 **
    Write a function that display a menu to the user with the following options:
        1. Display student name
        2. Display student ID
    Depending on the user's choice, either the student name (option 1) or the student ID number (option 2) is printed on the screen. If the choice is neither 1 or 2 a fail statement is printed instead.

    ** Step 2 **
    Create a function that takes 2 integer numbers as parameters (one as a base, the other as the power). Check if the base and the exponent aren't negative and return the result of the power operation.

    **  Step 3 **
    Create a function that ask the user to enter one integer number and return to the console whether the number can be divided by 2, 3 or both.

    ** Step 4 **
    Create a function that ask the user the year of his birth and display to the console the year when he'll be or was 50.

    ** Step 5 **
    Create a function that takes 3 floating numbers as parameters. The first and second will be multiplied together and the result will be divided by the third. The final result is shown on the console with only 3 numbers after the decimal.

    ** Step 6 **
    Create a function that ask of the user his favorite meal, favorite country and a year in the future. A statement will afterward be printed on the screen in this format: 'You will have the opportunity of eating {favorite meal} when you will visit {favorite country} in {future year}.'.
